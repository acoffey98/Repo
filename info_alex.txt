In the back end it knows what strings to use. 
Class functionality 
Properties file page, put file in proper package


There are two databases 

Look at the code 

Find the methods used to extract the data and to add new data:
Find out how the admin client populates
how is the panel getting populated

- Get an understand of how the panel gets populated
- How to abstract out in its own unique 
- Use angular and react or redux to display the page


-use the same properties for the page
- is there a better way to display the properties
-make it better
-demo GUI
-add extra ideas what to make it better
-how to take this page and make it better

-demo suggestions
- A list you can look through 
-check boxes that summarizes this is go mobile
what do you care about
- what do you care about is sync, or metamanger

-different branches you may care about or not and then have the option to do that



-Go mobile properties or metadata properties filters
-are there ways to 

- dont need metamanager so
-better ffiltering
-the only show properties is changed

this is a singular filter now
Do a fresh buiild

EX: Configure sync directory 
how do i figure out this?



AdminServiceimpl service- has a method createCollectionToBeSaved - 
saves in database

matches with i18n-strings

-This creates the map and returns it
-Doesnt do datbase call itself

Method saveCollection- 
-helper request
-That was called form createCollectionToBeSaved method and this is where it is goign
to save into the databse

doSave- use the mpa that was building up and trying to get fields out of that map

createSearchFieldsToBeSaved- 




Figure out what methods used to extract the data and to add new data to the databse:



Set up breakpoints within these methods :
admin client - 


saveCollection
doSave
getCollectionFeatures

See how data is pushed or whatever
- use that same methods or technique to create a new panel that would be able to poulate 
and using same style to update or populate new table

angular,react - is client side technology for better improving panels to display panels
- figure out how that panel is populate
-how the panel can update or add new ones, or remove them
-recall the same dosave methods and passing in collection parameters
for a new client side request  


DATABASE CALL:
getDeattures

creates connection object
statement
string sql 
uses database link name

conn = 
add breakpoint under sql = " " 
variable 
view sql object - get idea what its trying to grab out of DB 

put sql in dBeaver 
throw sql scripts and see what vlues come back in DBeaver

pulling data out - from users tab col table


Gets feature object and adds to vector list its trying to build up

WFS_Feature^^ 

methods- getCollectionsByPropert is the filter box and use propertyname 
- creates datbase link
does a collections search 
results sets
grabs collection by na
getting properties by collection

may need all methods or may not need them all the asme
how is panel generated
what methods does it call to generate panel
create own panel
create same methods to populate own panel
get a list of methods what it needs to populate panel
set up gui and see how to display the info i have
-filter
-gui
not using GWT to use panel, using REACT or Angular 

how these lists are populated and back to client
this is what i think it should like- 
populating and has content- pretify it
panels looking square and blank
