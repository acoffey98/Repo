Properties.java
-pick random properties file 
-Default values - set here are defaults (base properties) are default values 
-The idea is that if the user comes in here and changes this value it no longer uses the default values
-The non default values are the ones that 

if there is an alteration and go into database (getAllOverrideValues) - gives the values that has been changed 


The nondefault values are the ones that have been changed 
-getting all the override values that people have changed


on the first load - grabbing out of proeprties.java file 
-no database calls required
-generate the list of proeprties
-some of tehse has been changed
-we need to make sure the override changes 
-do it all at once at the beginning override the values that the user set it to
-srtat up first time make sure teh properties are correct 
-just trying to inform me that it gets all properties that have been changed from default 


net.compusult.wes.portfolio.Properties.OMIT_INTERAL_LAYERS_FROM_EXPORT - the override might be set to true


Any values that has been changed in the DB or sacved in DB are going to override the values that it gets fromt he overrides 

-Find location of client
-Using new technologies 
-With that 
-How the GUI is going to work with GWT 

-If it was with GWT you could plug it into and make new window 
-Third parties 
new pop up window 


figure out how library works: Java interface library 
make new module that open up windows with react
the back end is essentially java
own different front end, client module
make calls to server to populate those panels
    -
any idea what he wants to do witht hat
-new window module
-possible to integrate that with GWT ?
-or use the third party 

if we are:
drop a jar file for it in the libs file
-GWT calls we use, have been simplifie
getThreadRequestCall()

-write a custom backend for react module 
-react has its own way of talking to server from client
through ASync methods to make a request


-set values that aloow you
change the properties

ASKING: when we overwrite that 
change the deafult value ? 
-do it within the database Properties
we understand how they are getting pulled and added from 

how to display it with react, redux and new 




recreate a new servlet? or backend module and this server will make a call to 

request to get servlet 

Direct it from react- custom new technology client
-wants to find a way to siaplay these values in a more neat intuitive way 
-Other than just do a search 


-Libraries for react 
find some kind of 


filter out option maybe?
