call the getValues method

make a method and this might be already intitalized

DatabaseProperitiesStore.getINstacnce(getValues,

initialize- In constructor takes database factory class


from wes_site_config_values wscv - TABLE 

2 tables:

from wes_site_config wsc " +
				"join wes_site_config_values wscv



reuse the database stores properties class 

initalize properties store class- or create a varaible 
.getOverrideAllValues 

in order to initalize this class- 

make a call this this calss 


configModuleManager.getInstance(methods) 
-calling it from single location 
-call get configModules 
-call it from up to me
-Call the version of modules anywhere
-make changes 
-siteconfigconfig module IMple
-get configModules -gives you back a list of onlyy care about the sit config module out of that list 
and service config module 



The config module manager is where the configModule gets initialized 


RECREATE THE SELECT SCRIPT 
-figure out how i will initialize the database store 
-or how to call instance of this method
-so i can get overrides methods 

find a way to export properties from admin client and the config module manager- 



find out how to add new data to database- same in database properties store 
- call to set new 
- or call setValues



Idea of how the database calls work and populate the GUI add new content back into database
-figure out where this panel will sit
-where will this module still sit 
-properties is admin only 
-add a new package : In client- Admin
make subclass in Admin class
put module under client 

poke around on the GUI
-do gui and see the panel you like look of
-see how panel is initalize d
-how to arrange the GUI 
-view ports (great for tables) 
-viewStore () 
-figure out what calls i need to make 
-calling the getInstance on teh first module load will get the modular load 
-instance gets created and will always be there 


MY MODULE IS CALLED - PropertiesViewPanel UNDER CLIENT-> ADMIN 

create a new docable class - move around view panel 
- docable class 
- implements docable 
-valid locations to be doced to 
-url it can hit 
[4:32 PM] Tylor Mercer

docable is a interface how a docable will react. 
how it will handle 
-take a docable and put in seperate windows it need back buttons 
-it needs undoc locations
-essentially an interface the basic functionality of a docable

net.compusult.wes.client.widgets.dockpanel.Dockable
net.compusult.wes.client.es.startpage.StartFrameDockable



create docable- somewhat similar method calls
-start page docable line 50 
-MY docable will be in the admin client 
-Now create own fresh docable class 
-AdminDocable
